# rust_raytracer

This is my first project using the Rust programming language, focusing on raytracing.
The raytracing code is not meant to be perfect, my main goal is to learn more about Rust.

I plan to rewrite the code over time, trying other Rust techniques. 
These updates will be available in separate branches of this repository.
