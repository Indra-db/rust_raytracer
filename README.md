# rust_raytracer

my first rust project. The purpose of this project was learning rust.
The raytracing code is not perfect, and it's not meant to be perfect, my only purpose is learning the rust language.

I'm planning on rewriting this code multiple times introducing different rust idioms. These rewrites will happen in branches of this repo.
